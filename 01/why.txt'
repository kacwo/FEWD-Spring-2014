I am interested in taking this course primarily to make myself more marketable in the graphic design field. Ultimately to obtain full time employment in my field.  I presently do mostly freelance print design work. Most of the job descriptions labeled graphic design often want someone with web experience. I have some web design experience but not totally comfortable with the code. I have taking some self study courses in HTML/CSS and Dreamweaver but not performing the tasks on a regular basis, I often forget what should be done.
